# Flashcard Generator (CLI)

This is a simple Command Line Application for creating and reading either Basic (Front/Back) or Cloze (Partial) flashcards.

The application is built using the Inquirer and the fs NPM's.

When the user chooses to create a new study topic, a direcotry is created in order to store the Flashcard data inside of JSON files. Those same directories and files are later used in the "Study" section of the application.

This project was built as an experiment, and will not be maintained any further.
